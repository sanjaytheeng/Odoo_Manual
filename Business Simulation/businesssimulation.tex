\section{Introduction: Coffee Shop Simulation}
\textbf{Event Date:} \today

\noindent \textbf{Simulation Theme:} “From Beans to Balance Sheets”

\medskip
\noindent In this immersive business simulation, students will operate a fictional but realistic coffee shop named “Coffee Shop” — from sourcing green coffee beans to serving customers and managing financial records using Odoo ERP.

\medskip
\noindent The goal is not merely to learn accounting software — but to experience the full lifecycle of financial operations in a small retail business using Odoo as the central nervous system.

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\medskip
\noindent Students will form teams representing key functional departments. Each team will use specific Odoo modules to manage real-time transactions: purchases, sales, inventory, payroll, bank reconciliations, invoicing, budgeting, and reporting.

\medskip
\noindent Why a Coffee Shop?

\noindent A coffee shop is a microcosm of retail commerce:

\medskip
\noindent High-volume, low-margin transactions

\noindent Perishable inventory (beans, milk)

\noindent Daily cash flow cycles

\noindent Multiple suppliers (roasters, dairy, sugar, cups)

\noindent Staff wages, rent, utilities, marketing

\noindent Using Odoo Accounting \& Finance, students will simulate everything from recording a \$3 latte sale to preparing monthly P\&L statements — all within a single integrated platform.

\medskip
\noindent “You don’t just run a coffee shop — you run a financial engine.” 
\end{minipage}%

\end{minipage}

\section{The Expo Day: “Coffee \& Cash” Financial Fair}
On the final day of the simulation, we host the “Coffee \& Cash” Financial Fair — a live expo where students present their Odoo-powered coffee shop operations to faculty, staff, and guest evaluators.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/accounting.png}
\end{center}

\medskip
\noindent How It Works:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every visitor (faculty/staff) receives “BrewCash” vouchers worth NPR 1,000–2,000.
    \item Visitors spend these vouchers purchasing coffee, pastries, or merchandise at the simulated café counter.
    \item Sales are recorded live in Odoo by the Sales \& Accounting teams.
    At the end of the day, teams submit:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Real-time sales reports
        \item Inventory usage logs
        \item Expense summaries
        \item Profitability analysis
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent Winner Announcement:
The team with the most accurate, transparent, and professional financial documentation — demonstrating best practices in Odoo — wins the “Golden Espresso Cup” Award.

\medskip
\noindent Each student will also demonstrate mastery of one Odoo module they personally managed during the simulation.
